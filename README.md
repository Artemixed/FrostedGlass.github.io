Heyo! Thanks for taking a look at my first attempt of making a custom startpage!

# Setup 
Checkout this cool guide over at [HelpDeskGeek](https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/how-to-change-the-start-page-in-chrome-and-any-web-browser/)!
The link you can set as startpage can be https://artemixed.github.io/FrostedNight/ or download the files locally!
## Troubleshooting 
The page may not look like it's intended to, likely you're using firefox or an older browser.
When you're using firefox you may need to enable certain features! This can be done by going to:
1. Navigate to about:config
2. set layout.css.backdrop-filter.enabled to true 
3. set gfx.webrender.all to true
